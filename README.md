# AI Text Formatting by Command
This project is a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an AI-powered text formatting system. It processes text inputs and applies specific formatting commands automatically using Python code and AI integration.

# Project Overview
The notebook contains examples of how to parse and transform text using AI models combined with Python scripting. It showcases command-based formatting, such as adjusting punctuation, capitalization, spacing, and other stylistic aspects of text to improve readability and presentation.

# Features
Command-driven text formatting using AI

# Flexible and extensible Python code for text processing

# Examples of input and formatted output
Can be used as a prototype for more complex natural language formatting tasks

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
OpenAI API (or similar AI integration)
Regular expressions and string manipulation techniques

# How to Run
Install Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook if not already installed.

Clone this repository or download the notebook file.

Install required Python packages (if any) â€” e.g., openai, re, etc.

Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially.

Modify input text or commands to experiment with formatting.
